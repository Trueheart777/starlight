## What’s in the box?

Starlight includes all the features you need to get a documentation site up and running quickly:

- Easy-to-read typographic styles
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Simple-to-configure navigation menus
- Built-in site search
- [Internationalization features](/guides/i18n)
- Mix components (from any framework!) and content in MDX
- Support for custom styles
- Fast and [eco-friendly](/environmental-impact) architecture
- Compatibility with the [Astro ecosystem](https://astro.build/integrations)

With these features, you can create rich and engaging documentation that is easy to read and understand.
